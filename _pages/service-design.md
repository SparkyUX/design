# Service Design

Services as end users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a programme of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a new service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way.


## Scoping/shaping

What is it? - Working with the business and policy upfront to understand what we have, what we might need to do and why. This stage is about establishing the problem/costs/issues that you want to look at. Including the people and skills you are likely to need for discovery. At this stage we need to define the problem(s) and the desired outcome(s).

Questions to answer:

* Who are the users and stakeholders?
* Do we understand their needs?
* What underlying challenges do we need to address?
* What already exists internally/ externally?
* What do we want to achieve?
* How might this link to the wider digital strategy?
* What areas might we need to look into in more detail?
* What is the scope we want to explore in discovery?


### Workshops

Circa 5 days effort

A Service Designer will:

* Facilitate sessions involving key stakeholders/ users
* Understand and frame the problems you want to solve
* Help you sketch out a vision
* Create an agreed set of outcomes



### Design sprints / UCD policy design
Circa 4-6 weeks effort

Understand the policy intent and the needs of users to help design the policy and generate ideas for how it might be enacted.

A Service Designer will:

* Conduct initial stakeholder/ user exploration
* Document insights
* Facilitate idea Generation
* Run co-design sessions to test and build on hypotheses
* Create prototypes to test policy


### Exploration
10 -12 weeks

Working alongside policy, BAâ€™s and architecture to understand the main business drivers, problems to be solved and desired outcomes before moving to Discovery.

A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers
* Gather existing insight about the users of any current service and high level pain points
* Gather existing insight about user needs
* Identify SMEs and key stakeholders
* Align proposed work to strategy and programme vision
* Work with Policy to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Work alongside a Business Analyst to understanding the people, processes and data involved in any as is process
* Analyse failure within services and identify root causes for that failure. Identify opportunities for cost reduction and improvement within an existing service.
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Create service prototypes, and design touchpoints
* Work with the team to provide recommendations for how to take the work forward
* Frame and create problem statements for discovery



## New programmes of work

What is it? - Services as end users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a programme of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a new service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way.


A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers
* Work with the team to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Develop a strategic vision for the service
* Design the interactions and building blocks that make up the service
* Create service prototypes to test ideas and assumptions
* Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that matter to users
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent



## Existing programmes of work

What is it? - Service designers work with existing programmes to help connect discrete digital projects to deliver a joined up service vision, provide cost efficiencies, and increase the effectiveness with which end-user benefits are delivered.


A Service Designer will:

* Align and lead communication with service managers, product owners and policy colleagues to define user journeys and articulate the vision for products and services
* Visualise/map existing products and processes, highlighting inconsistencies, inefficiencies, dependencies, pain points and dead ends.
* Visualise/map relationships between different products or sub services
* Identify opportunities for service improvement and cost reduction
* Identify opportunities to align internal processes
* Identify opportunities to align our services with user journeys and tasks
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent
* Understand user needs and track interactions across departmental and organisational boundaries
Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that
