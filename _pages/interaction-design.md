# Interaction Design

Interaction designers are essential parts of service teams that want to meet user needs. They work closely with the entire project team, especially User researchers, Service designers, Content designers and Software developers.

Below are some of the activities carried out by Interaction and Service designers in Defra.

## Procurement

What is it? - Providing specialist Interaction design input into options assessments and procurement activates, focusing on inclusive and accessible options that work for all users.

An Interaction Designer will:

* Input into the procurement process helping create requirements to make sure the product meets both design and accessibility standards
* Making sure the design meets user needs
* Reviewing each tender against usability and accessibility standards


## New products/sub-services

What is it? - Work as part of a multidisciplinary team through Discovery, Alpha and Beta to make sure we deliver the right thing using a design test and iteration cycle. Interaction designers will work closely with Content designers to prototype ideas to test and make sure all new products are designed to meet user needs and are inclusive.


An Interaction Designer will work in all phases of a new product development lifecycle.

### Discovery:

* build knowledge of the subject and understanding the policy intent (work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts)
* understand how users interact with any current service
* help the team to identify and investigate pain points or problems with any existing service
* create high level user journey maps
* make plans for Alpha ('How might we statements', hypotheses and assumptions to test)

### Alpha:

* prioritise assumptions identified in discovery for testing
* facilitate design and mapping workshops with the team
* design and test multiple solutions to make sure we build the right thing
* decide on high-level to be user journeys (online, offline etc)
* test ideas quickly with low fidelity prototypes
* identify existing patterns that could be reused
* make sure the service is inclusive/accessible

### Beta:

* prototype detailed interactions, components, screens etc
* iterate designs based on analysis and feedback
* iterate and refine existing design patterns where needed
* create new design patterns where needed and share with wider Defra and XGov communities
* make sure the service is inclusive
* help the team test the service with assistive technology
* help the team to create a plan for assisted digital users

### Live:

* use feedback, analytics, and call centre data to identify areas for product improvement
* iterate and test designs with users


## New features

What is it? - An interaction designer makes sure any additional features are designed to meet user needs, design standards and accessibility legislation. They also make sure new features are aligned to the service vision and add value for users.

An interaction designer will:

* understand how users interact with and are affected by any new feature
* design and test prototypes to make sure new features are usable and inclusive
* create reusable patterns and components that can be rolled out across Defra

## External changes

What is it? - An interaction designer updates products in response to changes in external components, legislation or services that the application depends on.

An interaction designer will:

* understand how changes will impact users
* design and test prototypes to make sure new features are usable and inclusive

## Legacy products/sub-services

What is it? - An interaction designer works on legacy applications making sure products are inline with current design standards and accessibility legislation.

An interaction designer will:

* work with existing product users to improve usability and efficiency
* create designs to test with users working within legacy technology constraints
* help the teams to understand and meet accessibility legislation
