# Tools and resources

## Components and patterns

Design patterns solve the common problems so teams can focus on the things unique to their service and it’s users.

Check the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) to see if the component or pattern you need is already being used across government.

If you cannot find what you need in the GOV.UK Design System you can:

* [see if it is being worked on by other teams across government and add your findings](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/backlog/)
* [see if it is being worked on by someone in Defra](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-discussions/issues) and add your findings
* [propose a new pattern in the Defra backlog](https://github.com/DEFRA/design-discussions/issues)
* [propose a new pattern in the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/propose-a-component-or-pattern/). All patterns must be [useful and unique](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/community/contribution-criteria/#new-proposals).

* Check other departments for [design patterns and design resources](https://github.com/ctdesign/gov-design-systems-list)


## Wireframing

Open source kits are available for wireframing:

* [Google draw wireframing kit](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1d10Rl4X0_quNgLk8oPlgbXK4sfDU09OvpUsIn8Azsv8/edit)
* [Sketch wireframing kit](https://github.com/abbott567/sketch_wireframing_kit)

* [Sketch flow kit](https://github.com/charlesrt/gov-flow)
* [Google draw flow kit](https://www.beatnic.co.uk/2019/10/04/google-drawing-template-gov-flow-kit/)


### Gov.uk Prototype kit

Use the Gov.uk Prototype kit to produce working prototypes.

Use the Defra [GitHub account](https://github.com/defra-design) for version control and sharing code, to get a repo set up contact the UCD Operations team or your line manager.

To get an account you must set up [two factor authentication](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication).

All prototype repo's must be named with an _proto and be managed by the design team.

* [View the design team prototype repositories on github](https://github.com/orgs/DEFRA/teams/design/repositories)
* [View the design team prototype repositories on the new design team github](https://github.com/defra-design)

Use [Heroku](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku) for hosting your password protected prototypes.

* Download the [Gov.uk prototype kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)
* Converts Google Docs into [Govspeak](https://govspeak-preview.herokuapp.com/convert) ready for Specialist Publisher
