# Interaction Design

Interaction designers are essential parts of service teams that want to meet user needs. They work closely with the entire project team, especially User researchers, Service designers, Content designers and Software developers.

Below are some of the activities carried out by Interaction and Service designers in Defra.

### Discovery

In Discovery we work with user researchers to understand the service users, their experiences, goals and motivations.

* build knowledge of the subject and understand the policy intent (work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts)
* understand how users interact with any current service
* attend user research (listen to phone calls, meet users, observe how people interact with current services)
* create user journey maps
* help the team to identify and investigate pain points or problems with an existing service
* help the team define their focus by creating a well-defined problem statement
* identify the riskiest assumptions
* make plans for Alpha ('How might we statements', challenge the need for an Alpha, should there be more than 1 Alpha?)

### Alpha

In Alpha we try out different or new solutions to the problems defined in discovery

* work out the best way to let users interact with the service
* challenge the way things are done at the moment
* test the riskiest assumptions
* design and test multiple solutions to make sure we build the right thing
* decide on high-level to be user journeys (online, offline, happy path, sad path etc)
* facilitate co-design sessions with stakeholders, content designers, developers etc
* test ideas quickly with low fidelity prototypes
* work closely with the user researcher and attend user research sessions
* identify existing patterns that could be reused
* communicate design decisions to stakeholders
* make sure the service is inclusive

### Beta

In Beta we take the best idea from alpha and start building it for real

* create high level journey maps
* design flow diagrams, screen or question sequences
* prototype detailed interactions, components, screens etc  
* communicate design decisions to stakeholders
* help plan research goals
* attend research sessions
* help with research analysis
* iterate designs based on analysis and feedback
* iterate and refine existing design patterns where needed
* create new design patterns where needed and share with wider community
* help the team to challenge any unnecessary questions or requests for information
* make sure the service is inclusive
* help the team to test the service with assistive technology
* help the team to create a plan for assisted digital users

### Live and continuous improvement

We continue to iterate services with live data and feedback

* use feedback, analytics, and call centre data to identify areas for service improvement
* share research on existing Gov.uk patterns on Github
* share any new components or patterns in Defra and cross Gov
* share service findings and research that may influence Defra design standards and guidance documents


# Service Design

Services as end users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a programme of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a new service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way.
 

## Scoping/shaping

What is it? - Working with the business and policy upfront to understand what we have, what we might need to do and why. This stage is about establishing the problem/costs/issues that you want to look at. Including the people and skills you are likely to need for discovery. At this stage we need to define the problem(s) and the desired outcome(s).

Questions to answer:

* Who are the users and stakeholders?
* Do we understand their needs?
* What underlying challenges do we need to address?
* What already exists internally/ externally?
* What do we want to achieve?
* How might this link to the wider digital strategy?
* What areas might we need to look into in more detail?
* What is the scope we want to explore in discovery?


### Workshops

Circa 5 days effort

A Service Designer will:

* Facilitate sessions involving key stakeholders/ users
* Understand and frame the problems you want to solve
* Help you sketch out a vision
* Create an agreed set of outcomes



### Design sprints / UCD policy design
Circa 4-6 weeks effort
 
Understand the policy intent and the needs of users to help design the policy and generate ideas for how it might be enacted.
 
A Service Designer will:
 
* Conduct initial stakeholder/ user exploration
* Document insights
* Facilitate idea Generation
* Run co-design sessions to test and build on hypotheses
* Create prototypes to test policy


### Pre discovery (feasibility study)
10 -12 weeks

Working alongside policy, BAâ€™s and architecture to understand the main business drivers, problems to be solved and desired outcomes before moving to Discovery. 

A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers 
* Gather existing insight about the users of any current service and high level pain points 
* Gather existing insight about user needs
* Identify SMEs and key stakeholders
* Align proposed work to strategy and programme vision
* Work with Policy to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Work alongside a Business Analyst to understanding the people, processes and data involved in any as is process
* Analyse failure within services and identify root causes for that failure. Identify opportunities for cost reduction and improvement within an existing service.
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Create service prototypes, and design touchpoints
* Work with the team to provide recommendations for how to take the work forward
* Frame and create problem statements for discovery



## New programmes of work
 
What is it? - Services as end users would know them transcend delivery or product teams. Service designers work across a programme of work to design the interactions and building blocks that make a new service. The service designer may support multiple product teams to provide insight on how to achieve desired outcomes in a measurable way.
 

A Service Designer will:

* Identify the main business drivers 
* Work with the team to define the problems we are trying to solve
* Work with Policy to define the outcomes we want to deliver
* Create as is user journeys, highlighting pain points, dependencies, areas for improvements and hypothesis to test
* Develop a strategic vision for the service 
* Design the interactions and building blocks that make up the service
* Create service prototypes to test ideas and assumptions
* Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that matter to users
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent



## Existing programmes of work

What is it? - Service designers work with existing programmes to help connect discrete digital projects to deliver a joined up service vision, provide cost efficiencies, and increase the effectiveness with which end-user benefits are delivered.


A Service Designer will:

* Align and lead communication with service managers, product owners and policy colleagues to define user journeys and articulate the vision for products and services 
* Visualise/map existing products and processes, highlighting inconsistencies, inefficiencies, dependencies, pain points and dead ends.
* Visualise/map relationships between different products or sub services
* Identify opportunities for service improvement and cost reduction
* Identify opportunities to align internal processes 
* Identify opportunities to align our services with user journeys and tasks 
* Lead on ensuring that interactions and user journeys across the programme are rational and consistent
* Understand user needs and track interactions across departmental and organisational boundaries 
Influence performance reporting so we measure and target improvements to things that
